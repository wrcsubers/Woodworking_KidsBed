# Woodworking Stuff: Kid's Bed Frame

This is a simple Twin sized bed frame made from dimensional lumber.  This bed frame is designed to be modular so it can be easily transformed into a bunk bed by using taller posts.

I used an 8" Memory Foam mattress, and I wouldn't recommend anything taller than that as you lose side-rail height.  The height of the side rail is set at 12" to allow ample storage beneath the bed, my 2-1/2 year old son had no problem climbing in/out of bed himself at this height.
